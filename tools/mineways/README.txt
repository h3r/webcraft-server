There are different major versions of Mineways. You usually want the latest version; version 1.15 can be used on older worlds.
Version 4.* works on Minecraft 1.2 to 1.8 and beyond, 64-bit for large exports.
Version 3.* works on Minecraft 1.2 to 1.7 worlds (Anvil, stair geometry changes, and new texturing).
Version 2.* works on Minecraft 1.2 to 1.4 worlds (Anvil format).
Version 1.* works on Minecraft 1.1 worlds and earlier (McRegion format).

Much of the original interface and file read code is from Minutor, http://seancode.com/minutor/ - all hail Sean Kasun!
